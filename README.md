# Reinforcement_Learning_For_Predictive_Analytics
This is the second of my implementations of Predictive Analysis based on what I found after seeing Siraj Raval's video on youtube.

  - Definately just the start and much needed work to get this to where it is useable 
  - Just learning this stuff, so should anyone have any more experience in this space, I would love to hear the do's and dont's in this space
  - I think the magic with any of these projects is a byproduct of all those involved. So clone and have fun with the learning

# To run

  - This is just a standard Jupyter Python notebook
  - Follow instructions at the following link to get Jupyter Notebook setup for your environment: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
